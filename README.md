# Install 


Install the requirements using pip  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` or `py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt` 

Make sure a bs4 lxml parser is installed: `py -3 -m pip install lxml` 

Rename `example.env` to `.env` and change the username and steam_id inside  
steam_id is from the part after `/id/` in your steam profile url.  
Ex: `https://steamcommunity.com/id/AreUThreateningMe/`  
`USERNAME=<username>`  
`STEAM_ID=<steam_id>`
